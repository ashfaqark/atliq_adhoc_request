In this SQL project, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on a fictional database "gdb023," which included multiple tables such as customer, product, and various sales-related facts. The project covered a wide range of queries, including market segmentation, unique product counts, customer discounts, manufacturing costs, gross sales analysis, and identifying top-performing products and divisions. The queries helped provide valuable insights into business performance, customer behavior, and product trends, enabling strategic decision-making.
